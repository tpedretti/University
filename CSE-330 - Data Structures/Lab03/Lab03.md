# Lab03

This lab will have you experience three algorithms that solve the same problem, but do so with markedly different computational complexities.
The problem to solve is the “maximal subsequence sum” problem from our textbook (Weiss, DSAAC++) in chapter 2. A vector of arbitrary positive and negative integers is given. In this sequence of numbers the sum of values of any subsequence of contiguous values can be computed. The problem is to determine the maximal sum of this sort that can be computed for the given vector.
