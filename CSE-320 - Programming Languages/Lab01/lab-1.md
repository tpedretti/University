# Lab 1

Lab 1 is intended to give you time to familiarize yourself with Racket.

For your assignment, complete the "Do Now" problem from the end of [chapter 1 of PLAI][c1]:

> What happens if you mis-apply functions to the wrong kinds of values? For instance,
> what if you give the `caml` constructor a string? What if you send a number into each
> version of `good?` above?

Take the code provided in chapter 1, and add additional code to answer the question.
Run the program, and write up an explanation of what happens and why.

Submit to me a `.rkt` file containing the code, and a `.pdf` file containing the
explanation.
